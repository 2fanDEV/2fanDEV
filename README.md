# 2fanDEV

### Hi!ðŸ˜Š

### I am Tufan, and soon will be pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at the Technological University of Hamburg (TUHH). 

### Concurrently I am a working student (Software Development) at adesso SE, primarily working with (Angular/TypeScript) and (Java/Spring Boot).

### This is my GitHub account. Here I will upload all kinds of stuff. For example I started to work with Python and Rust on the side, so expect more projects in these languages soon.ðŸ˜Š
