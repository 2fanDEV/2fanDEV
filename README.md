### Currently trying to figure everything out in my life
Mainly working with Angular and Spring Boot. 
However I make an effort right now to get familiar with Rust and Python.

In the past I've been working as a working student at a software consulting company,
but decided that after my bachelors that I need some time to figure out plans for the future, 
as while I do love programming, I also need to figure out if I really want to work 40h a week right now.
